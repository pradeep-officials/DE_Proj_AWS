# spotify-end-to-end-data_engineering-project
In this project, I’ll build an ETL pipeline using the Spotify API on Azure. I’ll extract music data from Spotify, transform it into a desired format, and load it into Azure Blob Storage or Data Lake. This automated pipeline will handle data cleaning, formatting, and enrichment for scalable storage and analysis.
