# spotify-end-to-end-data_engineering-project

### Project Overview
In this project, I will be developing a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the Spotify API and deploying it on Azure. The primary goal is to automate the process of extracting music data from Spotify, transforming it into a structured format, and loading it into Azure Blob Storage or another Azure data store for further analysis and visualization.

### Key Components

#### Data Extraction:
- **Spotify API**: Utilize the Spotify API to retrieve various types of music data, such as track details, artist information, and playlists.
- **Authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure access to the Spotify API.
- **Scheduling**: Set up a scheduler (e.g., Azure Functions or Logic Apps) to automate the data extraction process at regular intervals.

#### Data Transformation:
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean the raw data to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Formatting**: Transform the data into a desired format, such as JSON or CSV, to ensure compatibility with downstream processes.
- **Enrichment**: Enhance the data by adding additional attributes or aggregating information to provide more insights.

#### Data Loading:
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Store the transformed data in Azure Blob Storage for scalable and cost-effective storage.
- **Azure Data Lake**: Optionally, load the data into Azure Data Lake for advanced analytics and machine learning applications.
- **Data Partitioning**: Organize the data into partitions based on attributes like date or category to optimize query performance.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Azure Services**: Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake, Azure Functions, Logic Apps
- **Programming Languages**: Python (for scripting and API interactions)
- **Libraries**: `spotipy` for interacting with the Spotify API, `pandas` for data manipulation, `azure-storage-blob` for uploading data to Azure

### Workflow
1. **Extract**: The pipeline will periodically call the Spotify API to fetch the latest music data.
2. **Transform**: The raw data will be cleaned, formatted, and enriched to meet the analysis requirements.
3. **Load**: The processed data will be uploaded to Azure Blob Storage or another Azure data store.

### Benefits
- **Automation**: The ETL pipeline will automate the entire data processing workflow, reducing manual effort.
- **Scalability**: Leveraging Azure services ensures that the solution can scale to handle large volumes of data.
- **Flexibility**: The modular design allows for easy integration with other data sources and analytics tools.
